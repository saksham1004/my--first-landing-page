 ## 🌐 Responsive Landing Page – Built with Webflow

This is a landing page I designed using **Figma** and built with **Webflow (no code)**.

✅ The layout is primarily designed for **tablet view**  
⚠️ The design may not display perfectly on mobile or desktop, as it is optimized mainly for tablet screens  
✅ However, the website is **functional on all devices**
